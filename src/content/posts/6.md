something rattling inside this husk  
ushering the dusk and aperol tides  
instigating a fever pitched call to arms  
splintered knees before a congruent effigy  
the haze lifted from my bloodshot eyes  
oh darling, i see unhindered now  
beggingâ€™s indeed for the inner bitch  
and my bones are bent in your service  

stoned in your licentious light  
a hot thrush in the dead of night  
comatose yet veins still raging  

fuck it  
i dissolve a little more  
become a little less  
little more, little less  

iron and steel  
blood and leather  
every contorted form  
all for this crazy little thing
