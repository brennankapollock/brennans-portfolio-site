rip into this flesh with your palms of bone and blood  
lay me gently upon the altar of ascension blessed  
where i and you shall fly towards union untrod  

trampling over all disturbing lights of dominion’s mist  
oh sweet communion host me in this bed broken apart  
tuck me in with three small motions ancient in their unity  
rock me creating something new within my soiled heart  
swirling up to reach the eyes of all in sexual simplicity  
christ’s celestial vein pierced on a summers eve  
tears dripping unhindered from the hazel eyes of god  
moaning from the pain that we received  
a garden blooming once in suffering wrought  

upon the cross of our bodies we scratched sacred in spit  
I entered the holy of holies like a priest vested bright  
my flesh ripped and torn like a curtain finally split  
we persisted in sweaty discernment through the ripshorn night
