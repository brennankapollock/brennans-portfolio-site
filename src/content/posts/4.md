the drip of times past perverse  
sweet aroma of foolish folly  
it was in my blood once long ago  
turning peace into pain  
turning solid ground into swamps  
the wretched stench of new orleans  
slipping it's way into the veins of angels  
making men tremble into feeble boys  
contorting minds into vast canvases  
full of fuzz and the kernel of vanity  
they say it's quench makes you real  
but in reality it hinders your sight  
prevents you from seeing the light  
smog in the view of what is right in front of you  
all that is good, true, and full of life  
and upon rebirth nothing  
absolutely nothing  
nothing but black and ice
