**Verse 1:**  
i wrote you a poem last night, uh huh  
ink bleeding through paper thin walls  
laughed as it gushed like an open vein and  
here's your eulogy, behold the fall  

**Verse 2:**  
not even amphetamines could conjure, uh huh  
what your frigid touch could never ignite  
baptized in flesh and her sweat on a couch and  
stripped of my cross as i twist the knife  

**Chorus:**  
this is the last gasp I'll waste on you  
exhaled into the mouth of someone new  
your silence speaks volumes in reverse  
as I whisper secrets to sheets you never knew  

**Verse 3:**  
heartbeats thunder in hollowed rooms, uh huh  
walls swallow the echoes of psalms  
shadows writhe on consecrated skin  
as i rewrite the rules of this game  

**Verse 4:**  
bones rearrange under new pressure, uh huh  
cartilage bends to unknown rhythms  
i'm shedding skin that once wore your name  
replacing it with old and familiar hymns  

**Chorus:**  
this is the last prayer i'll waste on you  
breathed into lips that know how to praise  
your silence screams volumes in reverse  
as i moan confessions to sheets you'll never grace  

**Outro:**  
so here's your last poem, visceral and raw  
a flesh altar, defiled and renewed  
the ink runs dry, but the body speaks  
oh the body speaks  
speaks  
in hymns your ears never knew
