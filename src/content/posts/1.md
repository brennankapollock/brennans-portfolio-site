**Verse 1:**  
starlight fractures on salt-kissed skin  
echoes of eons in your grin  
tidal pulls of uncharted seas  
whisper secrets through you to me  

**Chorus:**  
step into your daydream  
where we flow, where we gleam  
in rhythms only oceans know  
your reverie, our undertow  

**Verse 2:**  
celestial dances in your wake  
ripples of lives we've yet to take  
in stillness found between heartbeats  
time suspends, eternity meets  

**Bridge:**  
atoms align in cosmic sway  
gravity of words unsaid  
in spaces where our shadows play  
futures bloom from moments fled  

(Repeat Chorus)  

**Verse 3:**  
nebulas swirl in eyes of blue  
constellations old and new  
in breath shared between you and I  
universes multiply  

**Outro:**  
so fuck it, darling  
let it spin, let it weave  
this tapestry we can't perceive  
beyond the shore, beyond the sky  
we'll resonate…  
oscillate…  
resonate...  
oscillate…  
in and out of time  
along this new life
