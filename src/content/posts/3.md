itâ€™s a comical consequence of the age  
that through the looking glass  
i see friends in a shrouded mist  
around them buzz: bees, flames, birds  
all appear and annoy and confuse  
truly unwanted and undesired for  
before my resurrection i rarely knew  
such digital creatures and ever since  
only one graceful deer frolics in sun  
through my leaves: in ink, dream, prayer  
through song and scripture she frolics  

i am a deer also though not as tan  
a strong yet soft creature of the leaves  
a slight silver limp from years past  
that is all i carry in my slender legs  
and as i rest laying down today  
in the good hours of the day i exclaim  
to old friends and birds and bees  
my star-crossed and sun-drenched state of being  
of being a man weaved into fabric  
of being a deer on cobblestone  
wanting nothing but her as a whole  
as a woman draped in integrity and exuberant joy  
as a deer in the expansive meadow  

i am startled and shook by the rustling  
a rustling as to whether to stand or sit  
to play it cool like the lonely masses on concrete  
or to listen to that volcanic thing that is my soul  
these leaves and the breath of god parading  
they shall tell me to be remain true to truth  
through these ascending days of spring  

i, a little deer possessing these:  
a wore out pen, a heart, two hands, one body  
holding nothing but to hope, faith, and love  
of a promise and reassurance  
if you will so softly assist me in the sea  
accepting the holy chime of the old ones  
the sea of spring, life, vitality, and dance  

so, the sound calls, i look upwards now  
i walk strong and secure into her meadow daily  
i, unafraid to give my all, the tender flame warm  
walking closer every second of every second  
i go doing fred astair's two step  
sealed as a sacrament with her  
as a deer in the meadow of forgotten realms
