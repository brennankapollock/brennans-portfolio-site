it’s always a fascinating thing to behold isn’t it? the ways people spend their most insular and private moments? those slices of time where nothing earthly is beating on their conscience. no stress from these pesky things called jobs they have created for themselves to be enslaved by. no consternation birthed from the messiness of human-to-human communication. nothing blowing down the barn doors of their souls. just them enraptured by the gifts i tried to give them.

i’ve been assigned to shepherd these two. i’ve been with them (and many more) since before the firmament was erected. it’s always amusing to me that they all have it wrong. the origin of it all. the support or lack it it that the extending space we weaved provides them. the way things end and where they “go”, which is an asinine idea for me, but i at least understand their fear, i would fear it too if i was them. 

if i was like them. but i am not. 

i do not live but only know. knowledge is my being. life is theirs. it’s my job here to twist those two kernels together.
